# RX5808-pro-simple
I created a simple one-button conroller for the RX5808 module, so I can have 40 channels in my Fatshark Base SD goggles.
It's really simple and has the following functions:

-Change channel via single click

-Change band via double click

-After changing channel/band you will hear as many beeps as the current channel/band

-Scan for the best signal and select that channel via holding the button

-Each time the channel is saved and it will be selected on the next boot-up

-It also has a low-voltage alarm for lipo, or li-ion batteries

You will need the ClickButton library to compile the program.
